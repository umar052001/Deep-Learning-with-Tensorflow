# This notebook contains all you need to know about the deep learning.
It contains the notebooks which I made during the learning of deep learning. It may contain more than 100 deep learning models by the end of completion of my basic learning. I tried to cover every minor detail and wrote all the code by myself.
Sections currently covered in this repository are:
## 1. Introduction to deep learning
## 2. Neural Networks Regression
## 3. Neural Networks Classification
## 4. Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision
