# These notebooks contains all you need to know about the deep learning.
It contains the notebooks which I made during my learning process. It may contain more than 100 deep learning models by the end of completion of my basic learning. I tried to cover every minor detail and wrote all the code by myself.
Sections currently covered in this repository are:
## 1. [Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/umar052001/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow/blob/master/00_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb)
## 2. [Neural Networks Regression](https://github.com/umar052001/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow/blob/master/01_neural_network_regression_with_tensorflow.ipynb)
## 3. [Neural Networks Classification](https://github.com/umar052001/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow/blob/master/02_neural_network_classification_with_Tensorflow.ipynb)
## 4. [Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision](https://github.com/umar052001/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow/blob/master/03_introduction_to_computer_vision.ipynb)
## 5. Transfer Learning
* [Features extraction](https://github.com/umar052001/Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow/blob/master/04_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_01_features_extraction.ipynb)
